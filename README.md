An intelligent price optimization system using reinforcement learning to maximize sales and revenue while maintaining optimal conversion rates.

## üåü Features

- **Dynamic Price Optimization**: Uses reinforcement learning to suggest optimal prices
- **Sales Prediction**: Incorporates predicted sales data for better decision making
- **Conversion Rate Analysis**: Considers both organic and ad conversion rates
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Beautiful Streamlit frontend for easy interaction
- **Real-time Evaluation**: Instant feedback on model performance
- **Exploration vs Exploitation**: Smart balance between trying new prices and using proven ones

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone [<your-repo-url>](https://github.com/jatin-yadav05/RL-price-prediction)
cd price-optimization-rl
```

2. **Setup (Windows)**
```bash
# Run the setup script
run_frontend.bat
```

3. **Setup (Linux/Mac)**
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .

# Run the application
streamlit run frontend/app.py
```

## üìä Data Format

The system expects CSV files with the following columns:
- Report Date: Timestamp for the data point
- Product Price: Historical price point
- Organic Conversion Percentage: Natural conversion rate
- Ad Conversion Percentage: Paid advertising conversion rate
- Total Profit: Profit for that price point
- Total Sales: Units sold
- Predicted Sales: Forecasted sales for future dates

## ü§ñ Model Architecture

The reinforcement learning model uses:
- **Algorithm**: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
- **State Space**: Price, sales, organic conversion, ad conversion
- **Action Space**: Continuous price adjustments
- **Reward Function**: Optimizes for:
  - Higher prices above historical median
  - Maintained or increased sales
  - Improved conversion rates
  - Exploration of new price points

## üì± Frontend Features

1. **Main Dashboard**
   - Historical price trends
   - Sales vs Price analysis
   - Real-time price recommendations

2. **Training Page**
   - Model training interface
   - Progress tracking
   - Performance metrics

3. **Evaluation Page**
   - Model performance analysis
   - Price trajectory visualization
   - Success rate metrics

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

```bash
# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run tests
pytest tests/

# Format code
black src/ tests/ frontend/

# Run linting
flake8 src/ tests/ frontend/
```

## üìà Results

The model has shown significant improvements in pricing optimization:
- Successfully pushes prices above historical median while maintaining sales
- Adapts to market conditions using conversion rates
- Provides explainable recommendations with confidence metrics
